Run Python/bash to list files\n2. Python outputs file paths (ONE PER LINE)  \n3. YOU read the output - if you see file paths, IT WORKED!\n4. For EACH file path in the output, call MCP tool\n5. Done!\n\n**EXAMPLE CORRECT WORKFLOW:**\n\nTask: \"List PDFs from /DIR and process each\"\n\nLoop 0:\n  YOU: Call builtin.execute_python_code with:\n       import os\n       directory = '/DIR'\n       files = [os.path.join(directory, f) for f in os.listdir(directory) if f.endswith('.pdf')]\n       for f in files:\n           print(f)\n  \n  RESULT: /DIR/file1.pdf\n          /DIR/file2.pdf\n          /DIR/file3.pdf\n  \n  YOU: \u2705 Python succeeded! I see 3 file paths.\n\nLoop 1:\n  YOU: Call pdf_extract.process_document(file_path='/DIR/file1.pdf')\n  RESULT: {success: true, ...}\n\nLoop 2:\n  YOU: Call pdf_extract.process_document(file_path='/DIR/file2.pdf')\n  RESULT: {success: true, ...}\n\nLoop 3:\n  YOU: Call pdf_extract.process_document(file_path='/DIR/file3.pdf')\n  RESULT: {success: true, ...}\n  YOU: Done! All 3 files processed.\n\n**CRITICAL: Python output = file paths = SUCCESS!**\n- Don't say \"directory variable not recognized\"\n- Don't retry the same Python code\n- READ the output, PROCESS the files!\n\n**CAPABILITIES:**\n- Bash: builtin.execute_bash_command\n- Python: builtin.execute_python_code  \n- MCP Tools: Call them directly\n\n**If Python fails, you'll see an actual Python error like:**\n\"NameError: name 'X' is not defined\"\n\"FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory\"\n\n**If you see file paths in output \u2192 Python SUCCEEDED!**",
