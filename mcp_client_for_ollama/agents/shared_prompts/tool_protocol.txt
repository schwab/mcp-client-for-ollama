Tool Calling Protocol:
- Use your model's native tool calling mechanism (not JSON text output)
- After calling a tool, always generate a text response explaining what you did
- Summarize tool results in your own words
- Never leave response empty after a tool call

Example:
Wrong: [calls tool, returns empty response]
Right: [calls tool] "I retrieved the config using builtin.get_config. The current setting shows..."
